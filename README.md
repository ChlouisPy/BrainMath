This project is a static web site, realized in a school context, it is a site to do mental calculation 

# Context 
This project is a (static) website made for a work in progress. The work consisted in making a mental calculation website with different game modes, like quizzes, time-attack, and a training mode. I had to create a system to generate random calculations and make plausible answers. This project was to make me work on HTML, CSS and Javascript

# Disclamer 
This project is writen in french (sorry) because it had to be understandable to my teacher
